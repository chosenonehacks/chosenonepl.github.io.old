  Hey there! This is my blog about my journey to cyber security lands...
</p>

Initial plans for this blog was to share information about my fighting trough OSCP certification. 

But now since I passed I might continue this blog as irreguarly as I did on OSCP times. Contents of this blog are mainly just for me. So I don't care wether you read or not ;)

That's it for now, will add more later or not.

You can follow me on twitter [@hal9k2pl](https://twitter.com/hal9k2pl).

Thanks for reading!
