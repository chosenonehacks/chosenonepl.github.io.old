I decided to start my [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-training/penetration-testing-training-kali-linux/) certification journey. I will be trying to document my struggles over the period of lab access up to exam day.

It was a very hard decision for me if I should start or not. I still don't feel to be confident enough but time will see.

I bought so far 90 days of lab access, but I think 1 month of extension will be needed, probably because of time I can devote to learning, as I will start new job from 2.11.2017

My materials and lab access should arrive on 12.11.2017 to that day I hope I will find time to play more with some vulnerable machines.

How hard is this certification you can read by looking on this [link](https://www.offensive-security.com/testimonials-and-reviews/)
