title: Finish of Exercises (OSCP pt.2)
---

My plan was to first finish PWK course exercies then dive in into the labs. I took me around 2 weeks. So Today I completed most of the exercies that were required for the lab report. Few of the course exercies that I left unfinished require you to to attack lab machines. So I will complete them as soon as possibile.

So my next move is to start hacking the labs. It would be great to have 25 boxes down before end of my first 3 months peroid, which ends <b>Sat 17 Mar 2018</b>. 

In mean time while I will be hacking boxes in the lab I want to prepares 10 pen test reports that are required for the lab report. They require from you at least 10 different types of attackes reported.

But back to excersises. The ones that I was scared most were expolit ones, but I did them all in one weekend, so I am supprised and happy....

Regarding video material and PDF attached to the course I think the content is quite good, and worth re watching it again to memorize of it's contents.

That's all for now thanks :)
