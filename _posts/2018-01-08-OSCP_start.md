title: OSCP Start pt. 1
---

Like I mentioned in previous post I moved start of my PWK course to 17.12.2017. I recived all materials on time, however probably becouse of holydays athmosphere I wasn't fealing like learning new stuff so I just spent time with family setting my new Year goals and plying some games. One thing I did was to prepare Kali VM, all aliases, and I also tested connection to OSCP network.

Today after Xmas and New Year reset from any security related things I started reading and doing first excercises from PWK Course, so far easy peasy but I think things start to be much harder ;)

I didn't mention that before Xmas I created and finished my VHL report after rooting 20+ boxes. After that I recived certifcate of completion which is very nice. I also wrote a review on their page, you can read it [here:](https://www.virtualhackinglabs.com/reviews/)

OSCP status:
Current number of excercises done: 1

Current number of rooted boxes: 0

Happy new Year!!
