title: Labs start (OSCP pt.2)
---

So I am already two weeks in the labs since I finished excersises. 
I think it's going good, suprasilngly good and I am getting worried that maybe too good. 
But maybe the hosts I got so far wasn't the hardest ones.

So far I successfully compromised 9 hosts which are:
Alice, BOB, BOB2, Barry, Mike, Pain, Payday, Phoenix, Ralph

I think it's a good number and progress considering that I have work and family... 

Playing in VHL labs before I started OSCP was deffinitly a good move.
