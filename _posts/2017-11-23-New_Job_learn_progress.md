title: New Job learn progress
---

A lot of things happen recently... I got a new job in IT Security. I work as a in SOC (Security Operations Center) as a analyst. I am working mainly in SIEM systems responding to incidents. It's not most sexy job in this area but my experience in security started to counts and I am happy I accomplished one of my goals which was work in this area.

Regarding my progress in VHL and preparation to OSCP course I mentioned in previous posts I currently rooted 17 boxes in VHL and I am close to completion of this course. I think it was a great move buy access to VHL as a preparation course to OSCP. 

Regarding OSCP I moved start to 17.12.2017 reasons behind this decision was mainly because of new job and I wanted to finish VHL.

For now thats all. Peace out.
