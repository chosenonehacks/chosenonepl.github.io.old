title: Preparing for OSCP
---

While waiting for a course start (12.11.2017) I decided to buy and learn from [virtualhackinglabs.com](https://virtualhackinglabs.com)

So far I didn't root any box in VHL labs, but I am going trough the pdf they privide (265 page long) and it is very informative, for sure it will be usefull when I will start OSCP.

I also alredy setup kali vmware box for VHL and OSCP, however I noticed issues with it, do not update vmware tools or you will have to rebuilt your VM. I would rather use Virtual Box, but both courses provide only wmware VM's and since I don't have a VM Ware workstation license I need to use crapy VM Ware player, that eaven do not support snaphosts...

I am also concerned about my Windows skills and I am prepaing snipets and materials about priviledge escalation. If you want to know how to download file from your kali to Windows machine please check below gists:

For now thats all. Peace out.
